# Human_Activity_Recognition
Self-learning project to classify human activities (laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking downstairs, upstairs) using Kaggle mobile sensor data. Built in Python with MLOps-Zero for model management, it explores sensor-based activity recognition.

## Approach to Problem Statement
In this project I will be building the level 0 architecture of MLOps, and  major focus would be on the model registry part. 

* How to manually save the results of the modelling experiments and the dataset used for modelling?
* How to manually save the models under the model registry? and,
* How to use the saved models at a later stage?
